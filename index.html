<p>I started this semester with vague knowledge of HTML from editing Tumblr themes in the early 2010’s. My time in this course has given me experience with:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>DITA</li>
</ul>
<p>For our first assignment, an initial digital literacy narrative, I wrote that I learn new programs as I need them, and often take the approach of learning by doing and googling what I need to know along the way. This remained true throughout this course, though I was set up with resources for each new concept, I often referenced them while also googling specific information I needed.</p>
<p>This strategy has been an effective way to learn the material, I tried to read through all of the resources first a couple of times but always had more success just trying to start doing the assignment and learning by doing. I feel confident in my HTML, CSS, and Markdown skills, and somewhat confident in my DITA skills. I didn’t have many issues using DITA for the structured authoring assignment, but the amount of tags is still intimidating.</p>
<p>The biggest sticking point this semester was working with GitHub to actually host my sites. No matter how much troubleshooting I did, my initial site would not appear with the CSS I had in my repository. However, upon checking the site again for this project after two months of not touching it, I have found it working perfectly. While I’m happy to have a working link to the site for this project, it is frustrating to have to work with a website that seems to just decide not to function for no reason. I didn’t have much of an opinion of GitHub before this class, but I certainly have a grudge against it now. I can only hope it cooperates for this assignment.</p>

<p>My first static site can be viewed <a href="https://lv56steelix.github.io/portfolio-site/">at this link</a>, and is a simple HTML and CSS site. I spent a lot of time adjusting the CSS to see how I could change the appearance of the site. The links on the site are fake and there is little text formatting,</p>
<p>My site from the structured authoring assignment can be viewed <a href="https://lv56steelix.github.io/structauth/">at this link</a>, and is an interactive site with multiple pages. It contains far more text formatting, along with a table including multiple images. It is far more complex than my first site of the semester.</p>
